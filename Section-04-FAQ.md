### Agile vs. SDLC Project Management - What's the difference?

Once you have an idea of what very high level components make up your project you will need to start defining the tasks that must be completed to build them. In traditional Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) project management methodologies the result was called the *_work breakdown structure (WBS)_* which was typically just a list of the tasks, their relationship to one another, and estimate of time for completion, and who they were assigned to. In SDLC all tasks were defined at the start of the project allowing the project manager to provide an accurate estimate of cost and target date for the project. However, over time it has been proven that for many types of projects this highly structured and rigid approach simply doesn't work.

Agile project management (of which Scrum is one methodology) is based on the fact that "you don't know what you don't know" at the start of the project and as you progress more details will surface that you'll need to react and adapt to. Agile methodologies are based on the following principles which contrast them to traditional SDLC approaches:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
