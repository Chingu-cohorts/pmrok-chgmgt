## What is a PM?

An Agile PM is responsible for managing the resouces, time, and scope that
make up a project to ensure that a quality product is delivered within the
desired schedule and budget. A Chingu PM doesn't just coordinate the project. 
She also acts as a member of the development team writing code, testing the
app, and creating documentation.

An important difference between a PM in a corporate setting and yourselves is
that since we are operating in a volunteer environment just like every Open
Source project you are also a coach, a motivator, and a role model. We can't
order our team mates we must establish and environment that motivates them to
be both innovative and productive.

In your role as a Chingu Project Managerâ€™ your most important two tasks are to
understand your teams needs and to remove any obstacles blocking their progress.
This requires a large amount of communication and a deep understanding of what
resources, including people, are available in the Chingu organization.
