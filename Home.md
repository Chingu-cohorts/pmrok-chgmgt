# The Chingu Project Management Repository of Knowledge

Welcome to the PMRoK Wiki!

## Purpose

The Chingu Project Management Repository of Knowledge is a place for Chingu
project managers to share information and lessons learned with one another.
While no one project management methodology is used within the Chingu
organization the ones used are all rooted in and Agile and Lean way of directing 
and performing project work.

The information included here is free for you to share inside and outside your
teams. However, as a Chingu PM you have the responsibility of helping this
site grow and mature by:

- **Ensuring that the information here is accurate.** You are expected to either
open an Issue for any errors or inconsistencies you find or in the spirit of
Agile development fix it yourself.
- **Collaborating with your fellow PM's** to identify areas of our project
management practices and processes that need improvement and creating the
content needed to fill any gaps.
- **Questioning the status quo.** We should drive continuous improvement by
reflecting on what we do, finding faster and better ways to manage our
projects, and being open to new ways of doing things.

### Issues & Questions

Issues and questions should be logged in the [PMRoK Issue Log](https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/pmrok/issues). This is important to ensure
that issues and questions are addressed in a timely manner and so serve as
both an ongoing reference as well as a historical record.

For information about how to open an issue see
[Section A4. Managing User Issues & Requests](https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/pmrok/wiki/Section-A4.-Managing-User-Issues-&-Requests) in
this wiki.
