## Nervous

### Ok, I'm the PM, but I'm nervous!

You may be thinking "Ok, I'm the PM, what the ?!?$ do I do now???" 

It's completely natural to feel nervous, especially if it's your first time being a Project Manager. Don't worry, we're a community of people who regularly get out of our comfort zones to improve. You're not alone (each Voyage there's anywhere from 40-100 fellow PMs with you, many of them first-time PMs). 

Here are a few reflections from past Chingu Project Managers (who once felt the same as you):

### How Do I Report Suggestions and Problems with the Template Repo?

The Chingus are a collaborative organization of individuals who share a 
common goal, but not necessarily a common path to success. As a result you
will have ideas and suggestions the Voyage planners haven't thought of.
Similarly, you will run across mistakes we haven't caught.

Making the Chingu platform stonger and more relevant to the needs of its
members is an important task and one that's one responsibility of every
Chingu. As a result please take the time to open an issue [here](https://github.com/jdmedlock/voyage-repo-template/issues) if you have an idea,
suggestion, or correction to report.
