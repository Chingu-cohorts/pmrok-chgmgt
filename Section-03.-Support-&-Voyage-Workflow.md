As a PM in a Chingu Voyage, you'll have access to lots of support.

You can gain support via the community (slack-channels: #project-managers, #ask-for-help, #resources-treasure, #community-chat), from facilitators (Weekly Check-ins, Repair Days), or by making an issue in this repo's [issue section](https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/pmrok/issues) or in the comment section of your Weekly Check-in. 

In addition, your team will use the Wizard tool, which provides both structure and a clear roadmap with tips, explanations and resources. The Wizard tool will also have a Standups functionality to help keep your team communicating and active. 

Below is a brief overview of how Chingu volunteers will support PMs: 

### The Voyage Workflow 

1. **Weekly Check-in** - The weekly check-in with Chingu will be sent out to all members at the start of every week and will be our way of assessing team health and to help you be accountable to your learning and team. 

2. **Weekly HeartBeat powerup** - HeartBeat is our tool to determine what teams need support. We use the Weekly Check-ins as well as slack & github metrics to give every team a status of: 

   * GREEN (progressing well) 
   * YELLOW (may need some support)
   * [RED](https://giphy.com/gifs/cat-fire-rescue-phJ6eMRFYI6CQ) (team is in trouble, may need significant support or to be closed down)

   Right now it is largely done manually, but Chingu's Lead Data Scientist @trion is currently working a machine learning-assisted tool to help automate this process. It's a time consuming process and part of the reason the Weekly Check-ins are so important. I (Chance) will spend Monday-Wednesday powering up the HeartBeat before... 

3. **Team Support Day!** - This day will happen every Thursday/Friday (and Saturday if need-be). We will use the insights from HeartBeat to determine what teams need assistance each week. Anything from troubles gaining momentum to looking for a replacement for a member who got a job, this day is for making sure teams are on the right path.

It's also worth noting that we are continuously looking for ways to improve Chingu and we will be looking for patterns with teams that reach Yellow and Red so we can find the root causes to improve the system for the next round to of teams. ðŸš€ 

### Community Support

Each Chingu Voyage has a few hundred developers from all levels who come from diverse backgrounds. Viewed as a collective brain, each Voyage is both a marvel of diversity and an excellent resource for you and your team. I encourage all teams to consider the collective brain of the Voyage as a team-mate. 

You can access this collective brain in the following ways: 

* **Slack channels** - #ask-for-help-here, #community-cht, #Project Managers, #resource-treasures
* **Weekly Check-ins** - there will be an opportunity to let us know of any improvements or ask for help on this check-in. For example, if you say your team needs help with Auth0, we may be able to find someone to send your team's way to help. 
* **Chingu Medium Publication** - Every week Chingu will publish a Weekly Update on the Chingu ecosystem and all the wild projects & news from Chingu members.
