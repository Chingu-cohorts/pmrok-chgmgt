## Why Contribute?

Keeping the information and advice in PMRoK up to date is important not only
for the Voyage that's currently in progress, but also for future Voyages.
Not only does contributing help build the repository of PM knowledge for the
PM's that will follow you, but doing so will also help you to improve and
extend your PM skills.

## How to Contribute

Making corrections or adding content to PMRoK follows a process very
similar to the one you use when making contributions to your Voyage projects. 
GitHub Wiki's are implementated in a manner that doesn't allow changes to be
approved and merged use the Pull Request (PR) mechanism available to normal
repos.

Due to this a "mirror" repo has been created that you will use to make changes
just like you do in a normal project repo. TravisCI integration has been set
up in the mirror to automatically push changes from the `master` branch once
a PR for a change has been reviewed, approved, and merged from `development`
into `master`.

The following diagram depicts the change management flow for PMRoK.
