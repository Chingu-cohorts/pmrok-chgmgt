## Nervous

### Ok, I'm the PM, but I'm nervous!

You may be thinking "Ok, I'm the PM, what the ?!?$ do I do now???" 

It's completely natural to feel nervous, especially if it's your first time being a Project Manager. Don't worry, we're a community of people who regularly get out of our comfort zones to improve. You're not alone (each Voyage there's anywhere from 40-100 fellow PMs with you, many of them first-time PMs). 

Here are a few reflections from past Chingu Project Managers (who once felt the same as you):

### This is the first time I've been a PM. Am I ready? 
This is a question only you can answer.  However, if you've read through this wiki and are willing to put in the time and effort, you can be.  Just remember to reach out with any questions immediately and to just keep moving your team forward.  The Chingu community is learning and growing together.  We are all here to support one another.

### What do I do if I need help? 
Everyone needs help sometimes. Be prepared to ask for it when you need it.  First, look back over this wiki and see if the answer is here. We will be adding to it often as questions arise.  Additionally, you can head to the PM slack and ask the other PMs.  Possibly one of us will have stumbled across that same issue and have the answer.
