**_blocker_** - Any issue or task that is preventing the project from moving forward or is preventing another task from being able to be started.

**_burndown chart_** - A graphical view of the number of stories in the backlog that have been completed against the total number remaining across sprints.

**_story points_** - A measure of relative effort or difficulty required to complete a given story. Part of the backlog grooming process is for the Scrum Team to review user stories and estimate the number of story points required for each one. There are many different methods that can be used for this and the one chosen by the Scrum Team isn’t as important as the need to be consistent when estimating story points.

**_velocity_** - Measures the average rate that stories are completed across sprints. The basic method is to divide the number of story points completed by the total number in the product backlog. Over time velocity is a measure of the work that can be expected to be completed in a sprint and it is used to ensure that the team doesn’t overcommit the number of story points to be completed in a given sprint.
