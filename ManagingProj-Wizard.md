## Using the Wizard

**_This section is under development_**

The Wizard is a Slackbot used by Chingu Voyage PM's to manage their projects
and post status of their teams and projects. 

To use the Wizard enter one of the commands below in the message box in your
teams Slack channel.

- `/team` list commands
- `/team map` will directly open the Voyage Map. 
- `/team next` will directly open the Next Milestone
- `/team standup` will directly open the Team Standups view (with the option
to log a new standup)
- `/team progress` will continue to display the progress buttons

Teams now have the ability to view their *Voyage Map* using the 
**_[Voyage Map]_** button. This map will display team data and milestone 
progress.

The **_[hide]_** button will now return the view to the `/team progress` 
buttons so you can quickly navigate between the different tools without 
blocking up your conversation.
