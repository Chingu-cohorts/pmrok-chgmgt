#### Project Management Organization tools

A major part of project management is organizing the information you collect
from your team and organizing it in a way that is actionable. Tools such as the
following help you create a backlog of tasks that can be tracked as they 
progress through various states such as Next, Blocked, In Progress, Revew, and
Completed.

Regardless of which tool you might choose a prime requirement is that the tool
must support sharing assignments and progress with the team.

- [GitHub Projects](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/)
- [Trello](www.trello.com)
- [Waffle](www.waffle.io)
- [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/)
- [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/) (better used as an ideation tool or the intial breaking down of a project to clone)
- [Asana](www.asana.com)

Here are some past examples of Voyage members using these tools: 

- [Github Projects example (Toucans)](https://github.com/chingu-voyage3/toucans-06/projects/1)
- [Trello example](https://trello.com/b/91AF3Eh9/chingu-project-example)

### Meeting Tools/Pair Programming

Conducting meetings and pair programming activities both require that you
scheduling sessions at a date and time that is convienient to all
participants. They also require that you and your team selecting a tool 
with features to help you to efficiently communicate. These features include
audio, video, text messaging, and screensharing. 

### Scheduling Meetings and Coordination Tools

Scheduling meetings in an organization like the Chingus is complicated by the
fact our team mates are spread across many continents and timezones. Coupled
with team mate obligations outside of the Chingu universe this makes finding
meeting times suitable for all team members as difficult as trying to nail
jello to a tree.

- [Meekan](https://meekan.com/) - This is the primary tool we encourage PMs to use for scheduling meeting times. Meekan will be installed in the Voyage slack but each member has to activate it with their calendars. PMs may have to Direct-Message members of their team who don't have it activated. 
- [World Clock Meeting Planner](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html)
- [Timezone](http://timezone.me/en/meeting-planner)

### Meeting & Pair Programming Tools

- [Appear.in](https://appear.in/) - some teams swear by this tool for it's flexiblity and ease of use for doing meetings.
- [Discord](https://discord.com) 
- [Google hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) - great for audio/video meetings and has screenshare functionality. Everyone needs to have a gmail account though.
- [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si)
- [Slack](https://slack.com) 
- [Talky.io](https://talky.io) 

#### Issue Tracking

Keeping track of the issues to ensure that they are quickly and permanently
resolved plays a major role in improving product quality and lowering technical
debt. The rigor your team shows in how they deal with issue reporting reflects
their maturity as both a team and in their chosen profession as WebDevs.

Some tools that can be used to introduce the necessary rigor to issue tracking
include:

- [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
