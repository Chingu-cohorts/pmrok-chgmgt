#### Project Management Organization tools

A major part of project management is organizing the information you collect
from your team and organizing it in a way that is actionable. Tools such as the
following help you create a backlog of tasks that can be tracked as they 
progress through various states such as Next, Blocked, In Progress, Revew, and
Completed.

Regardless of which tool you might choose a prime requirement is that the tool
must support sharing assignments and progress with the team.

#### Meeting Tools/Pair Programming

Conducting meetings and pair programming activities both require that you
scheduling sessions at a date and time that is convienient to all
participants. They also require that you and your team selecting a tool 
with features to help you to efficiently communicate. These features include
audio, video, text messaging, and screensharing. 

##### Scheduling and Coordination Tools

Scheduling meetings in an organization like the Chingus is complicated by the
fact our team mates are spread across many continents and timezones. Coupled
with team mate obligations outside of the Chingu universe this makes finding
meeting times suitable for all team members as difficult as trying to nail
jello to a tree.
