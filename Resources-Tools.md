## Tools

Below are some tools and resources teams have found helpful in the past. Most of these were discovered by people like you, so if you find a resource or tool that was helpful please let us know! ðŸš€ 

### Chingu-X & The Wizard

Chingu is a platform to launch opportunities for developers, but another part of Chingu is researching and developing ways to better facilitate those opportunities. We call this global collaboration lab Chingu-X, and they built: 

* **The Wizard Acts & Milestones** - This is a tool to provide structure and a project roadmap for teams to follow. Project Managers will log the team's progress here which will also help us determine what teams need support. 

* **The Wizard Standups** - This is a tool to better facilitate team communication. It will ping you twice a week to answer a few short questions (ex. What did you work on? What are you going to work on? What is blocking your way?) and relay that information back to your team. 


### Project Management Organization tools

A major part of project management is organizing the information you collect
from your team and organizing it in a way that is actionable. Tools such as the
following help you create a backlog of tasks that can be tracked as they 
progress through various states such as Next, Blocked, In Progress, Review, and
Completed.

Regardless of which tool you might choose, a prime requirement is that the tool
must support sharing assignments and progress with the team.

- [Trello](https://www.trello.com)
- [Waffle](https://www.waffle.io)
- [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/)
- [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/) (better used as an ideation tool or the intial breaking down of a project to clone)
- [Asana](https://www.asana.com)

Here are some past examples of Voyage members using these tools:

- [Trello example](https://trello.com/b/91AF3Eh9/chingu-project-example)

### Meeting Tools/Pair Programming

Conducting meetings and pair programming activities both require that you
schedule sessions at a date and time that is convenient to all
participants. They also require that you and your team select a tool 
with features to help you to efficiently communicate. These features include
audio, video, text messaging, and screen sharing. 

Teams may need to be flexible and adapt as need-be to make meetings and pair-programming adventures possible.

Here's an article for [Virtual Icebreakers for Remote Teams](https://www.collaborationsuperpowers.com/44-icebreakers-for-virtual-teams/)  

#### Scheduling Meetings and Coordination Tools

Scheduling meetings in an organization like the Chingus is complicated by the
fact our team mates are spread across many continents and timezones. Coupled
with team mate obligations outside of the Chingu universe, this makes finding
meeting times suitable for all team members as difficult as trying to nail
Jell-O to a tree.

- [Meekan](https://meekan.com/) - This is the primary tool we encourage PMs to use for scheduling meeting times. Meekan will be installed in the Voyage slack but each member has to activate it with their calendars. PMs may have to Direct-Message members of their team who don't have it activated.

- [Timezone](http://timezone.me/en/meeting-planner)

#### Meeting & Pair Programming Tools

- [Appear.in](https://appear.in/) - some teams swear by this tool for its flexibility and ease of use for doing meetings.
- [Discord](https://discord.com) 
- [Google hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) - great for audio/video meetings and has screenshare functionality. Everyone needs to have a gmail account though.
- [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si)
- [Slack](https://slack.com) 
- [Talky.io](https://talky.io) 
- [Team Viewer](https://www.teamviewer.us/)

### Issue Tracking

Keeping track of the issues to ensure that they are quickly and permanently
resolved plays a major role in improving product quality and lowering technical
debt. The rigor your team shows in how they deal with issue reporting reflects
their maturity as both a team and in their chosen profession as WebDevs.

Some tools that can be used to introduce the necessary rigor to issue tracking
include:

- [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
- [Waffle.io](https://www.waffle.io) Integrates into Github Issues
- [Airtable.com Bug Tracker Template](https://airtable.com)
- Any kanban system (ex. Trello) which you track bugs, categorize them and work through them.

## Wise words from past Chingu Project Managers

**What kind of resource do you think would be most helpful for PMs?**

From [Vannya](https://github.com/vannya): 

### 1
 I would say first, anything that can help PMs define scope. I'm not just talking about user stories like FCC and others use.  But just good info on scope definition to get to an MVP.
They can be written in any form.  You'll see on my board, we wrote a list of the features, split them into musts and maybes, and defined our scope as the musts.  No maybes could be touched without the others complete. SMART is the acronym for scope.....specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time frame (meaning what can be accomplished in the amount of time we have).

I think this has tripped up failing teams the most.  They spend either way too much time on scope and lose enthusiasm or don't do it and just code all wild.

Let me see if I can find anything specific to help.

 - [The PMâ€™s Role in Software Development](https://www.seguetech.com/the-project-managers-role-in-software-development/) 
 - [Manage Remote Developers](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/for-clients/manage-remote-developers/) 

### 2
Second, Basic git functions.  The PM HAS to learn git.

-Kornil's articles for sure 
- [Part 1](https://medium.com/@francesco.agnoletto/how-to-not-f-up-your-local-files-with-git-part-1-e0756c88fd3c)
- [Part 2](https://medium.com/@francesco.agnoletto/how-to-not-f-up-your-local-files-with-git-part-2-fc4e243be02a)
- [Part 3](https://medium.com/chingu/how-to-not-f-up-your-local-files-with-git-part-3-bf03b27b6e64)

[How to use Git Effectively](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-git-effectively)  
[Git docs](https://git-scm.com/documentation) 

Seriously, the docs are what I use the most for git when I forget how to use it.

### 3
Third, maybe resources to help them first get off the ground.  A good start could really get these teams to the finish line stronger.
- [Project Kickoff Checklist Infographic](https://www.wrike.com/blog/project-kickoff-checklist-infographic/)  
I'm trying to find something that isn't business focused for project kickoff meetings.
