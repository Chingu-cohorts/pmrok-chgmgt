# Defined: Chingu-Voyage Build-to-Learn Roadmap

### Act 1 
**Milestones**

#1 — **Meet the Team**

Everyone is accounted for and in the team-chat. Everyone has said hi and is in the process of building rapport (aka getting to know each other).

#2 — **Set Goals & Expectations** 

It's important that the team "has the same picture in their heads" as far as goals & expectations go. Common questions to ask for this are: What does success look like for this project? How much time can you expect me to work on this project each week? What tech-stack am I familiar with? 

#3 — Brainstorm Project Options

This important milestone is when you and your team choose the project. Use the Voyage Project Prompt article to help focus the project ideas. Teams are free to choose projects outside of these options, but be careful not to choose a project so ambitious that the team is destined to fail. Be both bold and realistic in this stage.
