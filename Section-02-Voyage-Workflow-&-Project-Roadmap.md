# Act I: Project Setup
 
### #1 - Meet the team   
 
*Goal*: Get acquainted with your teammates.

*Suggested Actions*: 

> Read each other's intro stories.

> Share a project or two you are most proud of in your learning journey.

> Share some prime picks from your gif collection.

*Icebreakers*:

> What time zone are you in?

> What sort of music do you like to code to? 

> What is your preferred learning style (videos, docs, dialoge etc)?

> What are your favorite YouTube channels, subreddits or blogs?

> What technologies are you most comfortable using and explaining?

> What technologies are you most interested in learning this Voyage?

## #2 — Set Goals & Expectations 

*Goal*: Determine the team's learning expectations and availability.
*Commitment*: 
> It is critical to make sure that everyone is realistic in their level of commitment and availability.
> Working less than you commit to is disrespectful to your teammates and can stunt the team's progress and morale.
> Typically team members commit 4-10 hours a week towards the project.
*Learning Goals*: 
> Evaluate everyone's current technical abilities.
> Determine at least one primary technical learning goal for each teammate
> Pick something that is 25% outside of the team's comfort zone / skillset. 
> Any further and you will likely be overwhelmed. 
> Any less and you are limiting your rate of learning. 
*Voyages go by faster than you think and you need to focus on learning through building rather than getting caught in research rabbit-holes*.
