## Sprints

With an Agile approach you will divide the time between the start of your project and its delivery date into *_sprints_* of equal duration in which you'll be completing tasks. At the start of each sprint you and your team will review the backlog and choose the tasks that must be completed in the new sprint. If you complete all of these before the end of the sprint then you'll start new tasks, one-at-a-time, from your backlog to fill the remaining time.

Remember that the goal of a sprint is to develop and release a set of capabilities that users could theoretically use. This doesn't mean that the app will have all the necessary or requested features at the end of the first sprint. Rather, Sprints build on one another throughout the life of the project until all major features have been implemented. This is the core of the agile approach and allows the team to get useful feedback throughout the project rather than just at the final product release.

Dividing your project in this way and planning and executing in a progression allows the team to adapt to change and to start tasks at the optimal point in time when enough details are known to allow development to be both efficient and result in something that is relevant.
