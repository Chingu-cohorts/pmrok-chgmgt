One of the most frustrating situations you'll face as a Chingu PM is when members
of the team don't respond to requests from you or others on the team. One of the
obligations shared by both PMs and team members when they sign up for a Voyage
is to commit to participating as a team and to see it through to the end.

### Symptoms

- A team member signs up for a Voyage, but never shows up.
- A team member participates in initial team meetings, but then stops
participating and doesn't respond in Slack.
- A team member communicates infrequently and as a result is "out of sync"
with the rest of the team.

### Preventative, Corrective, or Mitigating Actions

1. At your first team meeting:
   - Make sure your team understands the importance 
of teamwork, supporting each other, and the commitment they've made to 
completing the Voyage.
   - Collect everyone's Slack id, email address, and any other communication
   channel that will help you maintain contact as the Voyage progresses.
2. Identify members of the team who may need technical assistance and
schedule pair programming sessions to mentor and support them. Team members
sometimes leave Voyages because they are overwhelmed and this is one step
you can take to prevent this situation.
3. Life Happens! Events sometimes occur in peoples lives that will prevent
them from honoring a commitment. Make sure the team understands that if this
should occur what matters isn't that they leave, but _how_ they leave.
Communicating the need to exit to the PM should be a requirement, _not_ an
option.
4. If a team member stops responding, allow a reasonable time frame for 
continuing to reach out to them (no more than one week). If they still
haven't responded, divide their work among the rest of the team, adjust your
project schedule accordingly, and move on.
5. Use the weekly team checkins to report team members who have stopped
participating. Depending on the size of your team, the complexity of
the project, and where you are at within the Voyage, you might also want
to ask for the addition of new team members to fill the gap.
