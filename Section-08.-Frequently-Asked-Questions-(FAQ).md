## Nervous

### Ok, I'm the PM, but I'm nervous!

You may be thinking "Ok, I'm the PM, what the ?!?$ do I do now???" 

It's completely natural to feel nervous, especially if it's your first time being a Project Manager. Don't worry, we're a community of people who regularly get out of our comfort zones to improve. You're not alone (each Voyage there's anywhere from 40-100 fellow PMs with you, many of them first-time PMs). 

Here are a few reflections from past Chingu Project Managers (who once felt the same as you):
